<p>Two weeks ago I had a presentation called &#8220;Complex component design&#8221; at the
Global Ember Meetup.</p>

<p>When I had given the title and abstract of this presentation, I had wanted to
speak about how to implement more involved, nested components in Ember 2 (but
actually, more like 1.13+), which is a fascinating and complex (pun intended)
topic. I had something like a highly reusable autocomplete input component in
mind something that <a href="http://balinterdi.com/2015/09/10/complex-component-design-in-ember-intro.html">I had decided to explore further</a>.</p>

<p>When I sat down to think about it, I had realized there is a related and equally
fascinating topic, that of communication between components that live on the
same page. As everything is <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/38">soon becoming a component</a> in Ember, the two are
very similar. A difference is that communicating components in an app do not
need such a high degree of flexibility as a reusable component (like an Ember
addon). In any case, it does not hurt, since making them flexible facilitates
their reuse.</p>

<p>In this post, I&#8217;ll show an example of simple component communication and focus
on how moving from two-way bindings to one-way bindings changes that. Spending
some time on playing around with this, I was very pleasantly surprised in what
this shift enables.</p>

<h3>The example</h3>

<p>If you know me a bit, you&#8217;d expect the &#8220;app&#8221; to be Rock &amp; Roll themed and
you&#8217;d be right. I reduced the app <a href="http://rockandrollwithemberjs.com">in the book</a> to a very simple interface
where you can pick a band and then edit it on a form:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/tale-of-two-bindings/sketch.png" alt="Edit band on a form" /></p>

<p>In the remainder of the post, we&#8217;ll see different implementations to achieve the
validation and saving of the band. There will be 3 scenarios: the traditional
one, using two-way bindings, the Glimmer version, using one-way bindings, DOM
events and Data Down, Actions up (DDAU) and finally 1WAY Deluxe&#8482;: adding a few
features on top of the second scenario that one-way bindings make easy (or
possible at all).</p>

<h3>Take 1: Traditional, two-way bound</h3>

<p>Ignoring the list of bands on the left, the template belonging to the band
route, where the band can be edited, contains the band-form (on the right of the
screenshot), and some minimal markup. We pass in the band object, the <code>on-save</code> and the
<code>on-star-click</code> closure actions to the band form:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;panel panel-default band-panel&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;panel-body&quot;&gt;
    {{band-form band=model
                errors=errors
                on-save=(action &quot;saveBand&quot;)
                on-star-click=(action &quot;updateRating&quot;)}}
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>The controller has these actions, sets up the errors object and contains the
validation logic. The <code>hasErrors</code> property will be true if the band&#8217;s name is
empty:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='javascript'>import Ember from &#39;ember&#39;;

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  hasValidName: Ember.computed.notEmpty(&#39;model.name&#39;),
  hasErrors: Ember.computed.not(&#39;hasValidName&#39;),

  setupErrors: Ember.on(&#39;init&#39;, function() {
    this.set(&#39;errors&#39;, Ember.Object.create());
  }),

  validate() {
    this.set(&#39;errors.name&#39;, this.get(&#39;hasValidName&#39;) ? null : &quot;Name is required.&quot;);
  },

  actions: {
    updateRating(params) {
      const { item: band, rating } = params;
      band.set(&#39;rating&#39;, rating);
    },

    saveBand() {
      this.validate();
      if (this.get(&#39;hasErrors&#39;)) {
        return;
      }

      const band = this.get(&#39;model&#39;);
      return band.save().then(() =&gt; {
        console.log(&quot;Band is saved&quot;);
      });
    }
  }
});</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Upon validation, the errors are set but this is only needed to be able to
show the error in the template. <code>this.get('hasErrors')</code> is already true if the
band&#8217;s name is an empty string.</p>

<p>The missing piece is the <code>band-form</code> template:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;div class={{if errors.name &quot;form-group has-error&quot; &quot;form-group&quot;}}&gt;
  &lt;label for=&quot;band-name&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
  {{input type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;band-name&quot; value=band.name}}
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label for=&quot;band-year&quot;&gt;Formed in&lt;/label&gt;
  {{input type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;band-year&quot; value=band.year}}
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label for=&quot;band-rating&quot;&gt;Rating&lt;/label&gt;
  {{star-rating id=&quot;band-rating&quot; item=band rating=band.rating on-click=on-star-click}}
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary pull-right&quot; {{action &quot;saveBand&quot;}}&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>It uses the <code>input</code> helper which established two-way bindings between the value
of the input and the property that was passed to it. When the user modifies the
input, <code>band.name</code> changes in sync. Since band in the component is the model of
the controller, the band name in the list changes as the name is edited:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/tale-of-two-bindings/two-way-bindings-in-action.gif" alt="Two-way bindings in action" /></p>

<p>In this scenario, communication between the top-level component (controller, if
you will) and the band form is quite blunt. As data is two-way bound, there is
no simple, &#8220;in-framework&#8221; way of not changing the name in the list when the name
on the form is modified. There is shared state and the components do not act via
messages: they pull two ends of the same string.</p>

<p>(In cases where you had to prevent that in the pre-Glimmer era, you had to resort
to using a separate property, like <code>band.newName</code>, or using <a href="https://github.com/yapplabs/ember-buffered-proxy">BufferedProxy</a>.)</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s take a step forwards and see how this can be improved.</p>

<h3>Take 2: One-way bound with DDAU</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ll first replace the two-way binding with a one-way one and manually
synchronize the upstream direction using DDAU. It will not seem like a big gain
but it will enable us to go further and attain 1WAY Deluxe&#8482;.</p>

<p>The top-level template only needs a slight change. We no longer pass in an
<code>on-star-click</code> action but instead an <code>on-update</code> one. This will serve for the
upstream synchronization, setting what changed in the component on the band
object (the model) of the controller.</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;panel panel-default band-panel&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;panel-body&quot;&gt;
    {{band-form band=model
                errors=errors
                on-save=(action &quot;saveBand&quot;)
                on-update=(action &quot;updateBandProperty&quot;)}}
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>In accordance, the only thing that has changed in the controller is that
the <code>updateStarRating</code> action has been replaced by <code>updateBandProperty</code>. This is
the manual syncing:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='javascript'>export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  (...)
  actions: {
    updateBandProperty(property, value) {
      this.get(&#39;model&#39;).set(property, value);
    },

    (...)
  }
});</code></pre>
</div>


<p>In the template, the two-way bound <code>input</code> helpers are out, substituted by
regular input tags. We attach event listeners to them which will trigger the
synchronization proces (I wrote <a href="http://balinterdi.com/2015/08/29/how-to-do-a-select-dropdown-in-ember-20.html">a post</a> about how that works a few months ago):</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;div class={{if errors.name &quot;form-group has-error&quot; &quot;form-group&quot;}}&gt;
  &lt;label for=&quot;band-name&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;band-name&quot; value={{band.name}}
    oninput={{action &quot;nameDidChange&quot; value=&quot;target.value&quot;}} /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label for=&quot;band-year&quot;&gt;Formed in&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;band-year&quot; value={{band.year}}
    oninput={{action &quot;yearDidChange&quot; value=&quot;target.value&quot;}} /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label for=&quot;band-rating&quot;&gt;Rating&lt;/label&gt;
  {{star-rating id=&quot;band-rating&quot; item=band rating=band.rating on-click=(action &quot;ratingDidChange&quot;)}}
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary pull-right&quot; {{action &quot;saveBand&quot;}}&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p><code>nameDidChange</code>, <code>yearDidChange</code> and <code>ratingDidChange</code> all end up calling the
passed in closure action, <code>on-update</code>, with the name of the property that has
changed and its new value. This calls <code>updateBandProperty</code> in the controller we
already saw:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>import Ember from &#39;ember&#39;;

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  tagName: &#39;form&#39;,
  band: null,
  errors: null,
  &quot;on-update&quot;: null,
  &quot;on-save&quot;: null,

  actions: {
    saveBand() {
      this.attrs[&#39;on-save&#39;]();
    },

    nameDidChange(value) {
      this.attrs[&#39;on-update&#39;](&#39;name&#39;, value);
    },
    yearDidChange(value) {
      this.attrs[&#39;on-update&#39;](&#39;year&#39;, value);
    },
    ratingDidChange(params) {
      const { rating } = params;
      this.attrs[&#39;on-update&#39;](&#39;rating&#39;, rating);
    },
  }
});</code></pre>
</div>


<p>From the outside, the app works just as before. The band name changes in the
list as we edit it in the text field:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/tale-of-two-bindings/one-way-bindings-in-action.gif" alt="One-way bindings in action" /></p>

<p>However, we know that under the hood our code took control of propagating data
changes. We have undone the string that kept the two sides (two components)
tied strongly together. In the third and final iteration, we&#8217;ll leverage that to
move validation where it belongs and add a micro-feature.</p>

<h3>Take 3: 1WAY Deluxe&#8482;</h3>

<p>Now, for the cool part. Now that we&#8217;re free to change band-related properties on
the component without affecting the properties of the band object (the model of
the controller), we no longer have a shared state.</p>

<p>The first thing we&#8217;ll do is to move the validation into the <code>band-form component</code>.
<code>band-form</code> will be also less chatty. It will only send property updates when
the form is submitted. That means we don&#8217;t need to pass in the <code>errors</code> object
or an <code>on-update</code> action:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;panel panel-default band-panel&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;panel-body&quot;&gt;
    {{band-form band=model on-save=(action &quot;saveBand&quot;)}}
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>That implies that the controller can be really slimmed down to the <code>saveBand</code>
action:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>import Ember from &#39;ember&#39;;

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  actions: {
    saveBand(properties) {
      const band = this.get(&#39;model&#39;);
      band.setProperties(properties);

      return band.save().then(() =&gt; {
        console.log(&quot;Band is saved&quot;);
      });
    }
  }
});</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Note how the input field values in the <code>band-form</code> template are now bound to
properties on the component as opposed to that of the passed in <code>band</code> object:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;div class={{if errors.name &quot;form-group has-error&quot; &quot;form-group&quot;}}&gt;
  &lt;label for=&quot;band-name&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;band-name&quot; value={{name}}
    oninput={{action &quot;nameDidChange&quot; value=&quot;target.value&quot;}} /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label for=&quot;band-year&quot;&gt;Formed in&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;band-year&quot; value={{year}}
    oninput={{action &quot;yearDidChange&quot; value=&quot;target.value&quot;}} /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label for=&quot;band-rating&quot;&gt;Rating&lt;/label&gt;
  {{star-rating id=&quot;band-rating&quot; item=band rating=rating on-click=(action &quot;ratingDidChange&quot;)}}
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;form-group button-panel&quot;&gt;
  &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary pull-right&quot; {{action &quot;saveBand&quot;}}&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-danger pull-right&quot; {{action &quot;reset&quot;}}&gt;Reset&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Little else has changed but a second button, Reset, already gives you a taste of
things to come. Let&#8217;s see the component definition:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='javascript'>import Ember from &#39;ember&#39;;

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  tagName: &#39;form&#39;,
  band: null,
  &quot;on-save&quot;: null,

  name:    null,
  year:    null,
  rating:  null,
  errors:  null,

  // Validation code comes here, copied verbatim from the controller

  resetOnInit: Ember.on(&#39;init&#39;, function() {
    this.resetFromBand();
  }),

  resetFromBand() {
    [&#39;name&#39;, &#39;year&#39;, &#39;rating&#39;].forEach((field) =&gt; {
      const valueInBand = this.get(&#39;band&#39;).get(field);
      this.set(field, valueInBand);
    });
  },

  actions: {
    saveBand() {
      this.validate();
      if (this.get(&#39;hasErrors&#39;)) {
        return;
      }

      return this.attrs[&#39;on-save&#39;](this.getProperties([&#39;name&#39;, &#39;year&#39;, &#39;rating&#39;]));
    },

    nameDidChange(value) {
      this.set(&#39;name&#39;, value);
    },
    yearDidChange(value) {
      this.set(&#39;year&#39;, value);
    },
    ratingDidChange(params) {
      const { rating } = params;
      this.set(&#39;rating&#39;, value);
    },
    reset() {
      this.resetFromBand();
    }
  }
});</code></pre>
</div>


<p>I cut out the code responsible for validation since that has just been brought
over from the controller.</p>

<p>The interesting stuff happens in <code>resetFromBand</code> which is both called when the
component comes to life and when the Reset button is clicked. It copies the
<code>name</code>, <code>year</code> and <code>rating</code> properties of the band onto those of the component,
effectively resetting them to their original value. That&#8217;s the only reason we
still need to pass in the band object into the component.</p>

<p>Also notice how the <code>name</code> and the <code>rating</code> are not updated on the band object
as we interact with the form:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/tale-of-two-bindings/one-way-deluxe-in-action.gif" alt="1WAY Deluxe in action" /></p>

<p>Having the data validated by the form acts as a guard. The save action is only
triggered if the data was found to be valid. It is only then that the form&#8217;s
data will overwrite that of the band object. Data flows both ways but in a very
controlled way.</p>

<p>To take this further, thanks to closure actions, we could even display an error in the <code>band-form</code>
component if the save operation fails on the controller:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='javascript'>export default Ember.Component.extend({
  (...)
  actions: {
    saveBand() {
      this.validate();
      if (this.get(&#39;hasErrors&#39;)) {
        return;
      }
      const properties = this.getProperties([&#39;name&#39;, &#39;year&#39;, &#39;rating&#39;]);

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<h3>Take 4: 1WAY Deluxe&#8482; without input cursor wackiness</h3>

<p>The above 1WAY Deluxe&#8482; has a bug that <a href="https://twitter.com/rwjblue">Robert Jackson</a> pointed out and that
I did not realize while building the demo app. The cursor in the text field
always jumps back at the end of the text after each change:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/tale-of-two-bindings/1way-deluxe-input-wackiness.gif" alt="1WAY Deluxe input wackiness" /></p>

<p>During the Glimmer rewrite he spend a lot of time tracking down that bug, the
result of which is the <a href="https://github.com/dockyard/ember-one-way-input"><code>ember-one-way-input</code> Ember addon</a>.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s what we should use instead of regular input tags. We first install the
addon with <code>ember install ember-one-way-input</code>. That gives us a <code>one-way-input</code>
component that takes an <code>update</code> action which will be triggered at each change
of the input&#8217;s value (more precisely, on both <code>change</code> and <code>input</code> events).</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s replace the input tags in the component&#8217;s template:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;div class={{if errors.name &quot;form-group has-error&quot; &quot;form-group&quot;}}&gt;
  &lt;label for=&quot;band-name&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
  {{one-way-input type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;band-name&quot; value=name
    update=(action &quot;nameDidChange&quot;)}}
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label for=&quot;band-year&quot;&gt;Formed in&lt;/label&gt;
  {{one-way-input type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;band-year&quot; value=year
    update=(action &quot;yearDidChange&quot;)}}
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label for=&quot;band-rating&quot;&gt;Rating&lt;/label&gt;
  {{star-rating id=&quot;band-rating&quot; item=band rating=rating on-click=(action &quot;ratingDidChange&quot;)}}
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;form-group button-panel&quot;&gt;
  &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary pull-right&quot; {{action &quot;saveBand&quot;}}&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-danger pull-right&quot; {{action &quot;reset&quot;}}&gt;Reset&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Nothing else needs to change for the cursor position weirdness to go away:</p>

<p>Thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/rwjblue">Robert Jackson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/toranb">Toran Billups</a> for spotting this and pointing me
to the solution.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m really excited and curious about how many things this makes possible. As I
said in my presentation, we&#8217;re (but surely: I am) only figuring out both the
possibilities &#8220;managed&#8221; one-way bindings open up and the best way to work with
them. So if you have thoughts or insights, please do share them in the comments.</p>

<p>NOTE: I published <a href="https://github.com/balinterdi/tale-of-two-bindings">the demo app of this post on Github.</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The 2nd edition of my critically acclaimed book, <a href="http://rockandrollwithemberjs.com">Rock and Roll with
Ember.js</a>, has just been published. The number 2 does not only denote the 2nd
edition but also the fact that it runs on Ember (and Ember Data) 2.0 and that it
will follow the 2.x development path of the framework.</p>

<p>The 2nd edition adds 4 new chapters: Animations, Making an Ember
addon, Writing modern JavaScript (ES2015) and Deployment. Here is the complete
set list:</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduction to Ember.js</li>
<li>Ember CLI</li>
<li>Templates and data bindings</li>
<li>Routing</li>
<li>Nested routes</li>
<li>Actions</li>
<li>Components</li>

</iframe>


<p>A few weeks ago I wrote a blog post about <a href="http://balinterdi.com/2015/08/29/how-to-do-a-select-dropdown-in-ember-20.html">how to do a select in Ember 2</a>,
that seemed to be popular. I also received good comments about advanced versions
of the same problem, namely how the solution would have to change to deal with
the case if the items to select from are objects and how to tackle multiple
selections. I thus decided to do a Part 2, showing a solution for these cases.
Comment are welcome, as always.</p>

<h3>Multiple selection with simple strings as items</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s tackle the easier problem first, being able to select more than one items,
but the items are simple string values. The values will serve both as the value
and the content of the options.</p>

<p>I added some extra Bootstrap markup and a list to see which items are selected:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-8&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Select some bands&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;select style=&quot;height:100px&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; multiple onchange={{action &quot;selectBand&quot;}}&gt;
        {{#each bands as |bandChoice|}}
        &lt;option value={{bandChoice}} selected={{include selectedBands bandChoice}}&gt;{{bandChoice}}&lt;/option&gt;
        {{/each}}
      &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4&quot;&gt;
      {{#if selectedCount}}
        &lt;h2&gt;Selected bands ({{selectedCount}})&lt;/h2&gt;
      {{else}}
        &lt;h2&gt;Selected bands&lt;/h2&gt;
      {{/if}}
      &lt;ul class=&quot;list-group&quot;&gt;
        {{#each selectedBands as |band|}}
          &lt;li class=&quot;list-group-item&quot;&gt;{{band}}&lt;/li&gt;
        {{else}}
          &lt;li class=&quot;list-group-item&quot;&gt;No band selected.&lt;/li&gt;
        {{/each}}
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>I added the <code>multiple</code> attribute to the <code>select</code> tag to allow multiple
selections. Not much has changed from the earlier example. When the user
selects an option, whether in a way that clears the earlier selection (simple
click) or adds to it (ctrl/cmd + click), the <code>onchange</code> event is fired, and our
<code>selectBand</code> handler will handle it. We expect that handler to set
<code>selectedBands</code> so that the list of selected bands gets updated correctly. So
let&#8217;s see the controller:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  bands: [&#39;Pearl Jam&#39;, &#39;Tool&#39;, &#39;Long Distance Calling&#39;, &#39;Led Zeppelin&#39;],

  selectedBands: [],

  selectedCount: Ember.computed.reads(&#39;selectedBands.length&#39;),

  actions: {
    selectBand(event) {
      const selectedBands = Ember.$(event.target).val();
      this.set(&#39;selectedBands&#39;, selectedBands || []);
    }
  }
});</code></pre>
</div>


<p>For multiple selections, jQuery, aliased as <code>Ember.$</code>, returns an array of the
selected options values as the select&#8217;s value, so all we have to do is assign
this to the <code>selectedBands</code> property. In case nothing is selected, <code>val()</code>
returns <code>null</code>, so we guard against transferring this to <code>selectedBands</code> by
defaulting to an empty array.</p>

<p>There is one more thing you might have noticed, and that is the <code>include</code> helper
in the template. We want to mark the option as selected if its value is included
in the selectedBands:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;select style=&quot;height:100px&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; multiple onchange={{action &quot;selectBand&quot;}}&gt;
  {{#each bands as |bandChoice|}}
  &lt;option value={{bandChoice}} selected={{include selectedBands bandChoice}}&gt;{{bandChoice}}&lt;/option&gt;
  {{/each}}
&lt;/select&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>The <code>include</code> helper is not provided by Ember but it is rather easy to write
ourselves:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>import Ember from &#39;ember&#39;;

export function include(params) {
  const [items, value] = params;
  return items.indexOf(value) &gt; -1;
}

export default Ember.Helper.helper(include);</code></pre>
</div>


<p>That is all there is to it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/select-in-ember-with-multiple-selections/multiple-select-with-ember.gif" alt="Multiple selection" /></p>

<h3>Multiple selection with objects as items</h3>

<p>This is just a tad more difficult, as we cannot directly have objects as options
values. Let&#8217;s assume that these objects have a property that identifies them
unambiguously (which is a fair assumption to make), usually referred to as <code>id</code>:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>import Ember from &#39;ember&#39;;

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  bands: [
    Ember.Object.create({ id: &quot;1&quot;, name: &#39;Pearl Jam&#39;, formedIn: 1990 }),
    Ember.Object.create({ id: &quot;2&quot;, name: &#39;Tool&#39;, formedIn: 1991 }),
    Ember.Object.create({ id: &quot;3&quot;, name: &#39;Long Distance Calling&#39;, formedIn: 2003 }),
    Ember.Object.create({ id: &quot;4&quot;, name: &#39;Led Zeppelin&#39;, formedIn: 1970 })
  ],
  (...)
});</code></pre>
</div>


<p>We&#8217;ll use the <code>id</code> as the option value and display the name:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>(...)
&lt;select style=&quot;height:100px&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; multiple onchange={{action &quot;selectBand&quot;}}&gt;
  {{#each bands as |bandChoice|}}
    &lt;option value={{bandChoice.id}} selected={{include selectedBandIds bandChoice.id}}&gt;{{bandChoice.name}}&lt;/option&gt;
  {{/each}}
&lt;/select&gt;
(...)</code></pre>
</div>


<p>On the controller, we collect the id of each selected band, and if we need to
display their names, we simply make the mapping between these two:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  (...)
  selectedBandIds: [],

  selectedBands: Ember.computed(&#39;selectedBandIds.[]&#39;, function() {
    return this.get(&#39;selectedBandIds&#39;).map((bandId) =&gt; {
      return this.get(&#39;bands&#39;).findBy(&#39;id&#39;, bandId);
    });
  }),
  (...)
});</code></pre>
</div>


<p><code>bands.findBy</code> is our makeshift store service, which allows us to find an object
in a collection by its id. If we used Ember Data, it would become
<code>store.findRecord('band', bandId)</code> or <code>store.peekRecord('band', bandId)</code>. The
only other difference from before is that we set <code>selectedBandIds</code> instead of
<code>selectedBands</code> in the action handler:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  (...)
  actions: {
    selectBand(event) {
      const selectedBandIds = Ember.$(event.target).val();
      this.set(&#39;selectedBandIds&#39;, selectedBandIds || []);
    }
  }
});</code></pre>
</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>tl;dr</h3>

<p>I will publish a second, extended edition of my book, Rock and Roll with Ember
in about two weeks, at the end of September. Here is what you need to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>I make the same promise as with the current edition: you buy it once, you get
all updates for free until 3.0 comes out</li>
<li>4 extra chapters are added about advanced Ember topics, bringing the number
of chapters to 18</li>
<li>There will be a short launch period where the book packages are offered at a
discount.</li>
</ul>


<p>To be in-the-loop about the launch and know about the launch discount, <a href="http://balinterdi.com/2015/09/16/rock-and-roll-with-ember-2-is-coming-soon.html#launch-date">sign up
below</a>,
at the end of the post. Read on for more details.</p>

<h3>The short past, present and future of Rock and Roll with Ember</h3>

<p>Almost exactly 7 months ago, I published my book, Rock and Roll with Ember.js,
that helps people learn the glorious framework. Ember has since went through
quite some changes and I kept the book up-to-date with roughly an update each
month.</p>

<p>Ember 2 was released about a month ago, on the 13rd of August. True to the
&#8220;stability without stagnation&#8221; philosophy, the 2.0 release did not contain any
new features but dropped a lot of deadweight, API methods and syntaxes that had
been deprecated somewhere along the 1.x process.</p>

<p>Thanks to the transparency of the road ahead through RFCs and discussions on
other forums, it can already be clearly seen that the 2.x series will bring a
great deal of new and fascinating features. Routable components, angle-bracket
components and contextual lookup in components are some of the bigger things
that we can expect on the road to 3.0. The expected simplifications (for
example, routable components replacing controllers) will come with major changes
in how one writes an idiomatic app in Ember 2.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been following along the 1.x series with fascination and a keen eye to
apply the changes to my book and the included application. I want to do the same
along the Ember 2.x line and thus I hereby announce the second edition of the
book, Rock and Roll with Ember 2!</p>

<h3>Free updates policy</h3>

<p>To clarify, with Rock and Roll with Ember 2,  I intend to follow the &#8220;book
development and release&#8221; process of the first edition of the book that I&#8217;ve now
named &#8220;Buy once, get all updates for free (until the next major version)&#8221;. I
assert that if you buy any of my book packages, you get all subsequent updates
for free, until 3.0 lands (which is probably 12-18 months away. Geez, do I
really want to do that? :) ).</p>

<h3>New content</h3>

<p>Keeping the book&#8217;s current content up-to-date is not all. The second edition
will contain 4 extra chapters on some advanced topics (Animations, Making an
Ember CLI addon, Deployment and ES2015 &amp; computed macros) bringing the total
chapter count to 18 (the Getting ready for Ember 2.0 is retired).</p>

<p>Further content changes are expected as Ember 2 evolves (see above for what can
already be known about these changes), so the content on launch day will by no
means be the final content of the book. It will constantly improve and be kept
in-sync with the latest stable 2.x version of Ember.</p>

<h3 id="launch-date">When does it launch?</h3>


<p>Very soon, probably in two weeks, mark the date (with a pencil, for the moment):
September 30, 2015.</p>

<p>Stand ready, Rock and Roll with Ember 2 is coming to a virtual bookstore near
you!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just released another update to the Rock and Roll with Ember.js book,
keeping it in sync with Ember 1.13.9. On top of that (mostly on top of that,
since there weren&#8217;t as many things to do for the Ember upgrade), I added some
content, removed some other ones, fixed a few wrong paths in code comments,
clarified a few code lines to help people build the app along, and the like. The
usual stuff, quoi.</p>

<p>Here are the bigger chunks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extended the Testing chapter with a (controller) unit test. I removed the
component&#8217;s unit test in an earlier update (integration tests are vastly
superior for components) but now realized unit testing was missing.</li>
<li>Switched to a dashless helper, <code>capitalize</code> instead of <code>capitalize-words</code>.
Ember 1.13.0 and up auto-register helpers with and without dashes, so there is
no need for the more verbose form.</li>
<li>Fixed a few places where the <code>updateRating</code> action was still in the route.
When I switched to a closure action, I had to move the action handler to the
controller but missed a couple of places in the subsequent chapters.</li>
<li>The epub version had two missing code snippets due to bad formatting (thanks
to <a href="https://github.com/morganick">@morganick</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>There are a few other minor fixes, the whole list can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.13.9+is%3Aclosed">Github issues repo</a></p>

<p>I want to thank <a href="http://andrew.davison-family.com">Andrew Davison</a> who did most
of the error reporting for this update. Thank you, Andrew!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more goodies early next week, or sign up below so that you don&#8217;t
miss any in the future.</p>

<hr />

<p>The title would probably better be &#8220;Somewhat Complex Component Design in Ember.js&#8221;
but any title including &#8216;Somewhat&#8217; rules out pompousness. I therefore don&#8217;t
claim that the series of blog posts I intend to start here will represent the
pinnacle of component design in Ember. There definitely are and definitely will
be more complex component structures and scenarios.</p>

<p>The component developed in the series is one that autocompletes as the user
starts to write the input and allows selecting from a fixed set of options.
Nothing extraordinary but complex enough so that the design/interaction
principles can be applied and explained while developing the component.</p>

<p>Important disclaimer: I am not an expert on component design (which, it seems
to me, is quite a complex topic). I got intrigued by it thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanflorence">Ryan Florence</a>
and his talks and learned most of the basics from him. My choice of component
probably also has to do something with Ryan. He developed the ic-autocomplete
component from which I took several ideas, sometimes simply copying the
implementation.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>So you probably ask: why reinvent the wheel? Why develop something that is
already done and not something new?</p>

<p>First of all, I (and science says most of us) learn best by doing. I wanted to
use an example where I already have a sample implementation but also understand
why the original implementation did things as it did and see whether I can make
the component simpler or more robust. I wanted to face the problems, to feel
the pain of doing things a certain way, and find solutions for typical,
recurring problems.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also important to remember that when Ryan developed their autocomplete
component, there were no block parameters, no closure actions and no direct
attribute bindings. One still had to resort to observers in several cases.
Two-way bindings were still in, and the de-facto way of communication between
pieces of a component structure.</p>

<p>Ember has come a long way since then and its components converged toward those
of React in its reactive, &#8220;rerender everything&#8221; approach. Potentially some of
the ideas explained in the series can be applied to React and other libraries,
too, and thus might prove useful to more people.</p>

<h3>So many words, so little code</h3>

<p>To have something (almost) tangible in this first intro post, too, let me show
you how one would interact with the finished(?) component. If you have read my

<p>When the select view was about to be removed from Ember, a lot of people
-myself included- wondered how it was going to be replaced. My bet was on a
&#8216;select component&#8217;, after all, views should be transformed into components, right?</p>

<p>Then I saw <a href="https://gist.github.com/ef4/8367f996eb7b57d1f7a5">this gist</a> from Edward Faulkner:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;select onchange={{action (mut vehicle) value=&quot;target.value&quot;}}&gt;
  {{#each vehicles as |vehicleChoice|}}
    &lt;option value={{vehicleChoice}} selected={{eq vehicle vehicleChoice}}&gt;{{vehicleChoice}}&lt;/option&gt;
  {{/each}}
&lt;/select&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>I did not understand half of it, so I dug down to see how the pieces come
together. In this short post, I want to explain what I have found out.</p>

<h3>Solve a simpler problem</h3>

<p>A great mathematician, George Polya, wrote a book in 1945 called <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/How-Solve-It-Mathematical-Princeton/dp/069111966X/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g2147660602?_encoding=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0&amp;ie=UTF8">&#8220;How to Solve It&#8221;</a>,
in which he puts down a framework for solving mathematical problems. One
(probably more) of his recommendations can be applied to software development,
too: Solve a simpler problem.</p>

<p>Heeding this advice, we&#8217;ll first tackle a more mundane problem and in the
second round, we&#8217;ll solve the original riddle.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s assume Edward had written the following:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;select onchange={{action &quot;selectVehicle&quot; value=&quot;target.value&quot;}}&gt;
  {{#each vehicles as |vehicleChoice|}}
    &lt;option value={{vehicleChoice}} selected={{eq vehicle vehicleChoice}}&gt;{{vehicleChoice}}&lt;/option&gt;
  {{/each}}
&lt;/select&gt;</code></pre>
</div>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is easier (as in: more familiar) but there are still a few things that
might need explanation. First, before 1.13.3, event listeners on browser
events could not trigger Ember actions like that:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;select onchange={{action &quot;selectVehicle&quot; value=&quot;target.value&quot;}}&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>What this does, is that when the selected value of the dropdown changes, it
fires the onchange listener we added on the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> which results in calling
our action handler, <code>selectVehicle</code>. The handler just updates the <code>vehicle</code>
property of the controller. This will mark as selected the dropdown option the
user picked due to the <code>selected={{eq vehicle vehicleChoice}}</code> term.</p>

<p>(<code>eq</code> comes from a great little Ember addon called <a href="https://github.com/jmurphyau/ember-truth-helpers">ember-truth-helpers</a>. It
returns true if the two parameters are equal).</p>

<p>Since there is no two-way binding set up between the selected option of the
dropdown and the controller property (<code>vehicle</code>), this needs to be done using a
DOM event listener (<code>onchange</code>) and updating in the action handler. That&#8217;s
exactly what happens in the <code>selectVehicle</code> action handler.</p>

<p>So far so good, let&#8217;s move on.</p>

<h3>Solve the original one</h3>

<p>Wait a minute. How did <code>selectVehicle</code> receive the selected vehicle choice (e.g
Toyota) when the <code>{{action}}</code> helper did not specify any parameters?</p>

<p>When the browser calls an event listener, it passes it an event object which
would become the first parameter of <code>selectVehicle</code>. However, <code>selectVehicle</code>
does not receive the event but the actual value of the selected option, how does
that come about? The missing link is a lesser-known option of the <code>action</code>
helper, <code>value</code>. The property passed to it is read off of the first parameter of
the handler and then replaces it. In our example, <code>target.value</code> is looked up on
the event object, which is exactly the value of the select option that triggered
the <code>onchange</code> event.</p>

<p>Ok, only one thing left.</p>

<p>The original example had this line:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;select onchange={{action (mut vehicle) value=&quot;target.value&quot;}}&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>instead of the more familiar:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;select onchange={{action &quot;selectVehicle&quot; value=&quot;target.value&quot;}}&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>What mut does here is that it allows updating the passed property, so when the
action is called, <code>vehicle</code> is set to the passed value, the value of the
selected option. That is it, we solved the riddle.</p>

<p>The same implementation pattern can be used to update the properties related to
checkboxes, input fields and radio buttons. This new way of doing things takes a
while to get used to, but we&#8217;ll see more and more of it with one-way bindings
becoming best practice.</p>

<p>(By the way, my PR to add a section about <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/670">the actions helper&#8217;s <code>value</code> option</a> to
the guides was merged yesterday, so hopefully more people will know about it.)</p>

<h3>Wait, there is more!</h3>

<p>This post received a lot of comments, some of which are inquiring about more
complex use cases. I decided to do a screencast where I implement some of
these. You can get it by signing up below:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am happy to announce another update to the Rock and Roll with Ember.js book,
in line with the latest Ember CLI, 1.13.7. Book customers have already received
the updated version, here is how it got better:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Update to Ember CLI 1.13.7</strong></li>
<li><strong>Upgrade to Ember version 1.13.6</strong></li>
<li>Explain better the difference between sync and async test helpers and how
these latter work in Ember</li>
<li>Make the stubs for creating bands and songs not take an id, to be similar to
how the actual API works</li>
<li>Update section about Ember Data being in beta</li>
<li>Show what the custom <code>submit</code> async helper does when it first appears</li>
<li>Remove unit tests for components as <code>ember generate component-test</code> now
generates integration-style tests</li>
<li>Extract the <code>wait</code> helper used across two examples (for showing loading
routes/templates)</li>
<li>Update jsbin in the Templates chapter to use the latest Ember version</li>
<li>Fix importing the capitalizeHelper in the code snippet in the book</li>
<li><p>Last but not least, the pdf version of the book now has page numbers and a
nice, expandable table of contents so you can jump to any chapter or section
from anywhere:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/rarwe-1-13-7/preview-toc.png" alt="Collapsable TOC and page numbers" /></p>

<p>I know, it seems extremely simple to have them from the start but the way the
pdf was generated did not allow for this so we had to find another way. I
again worked with <a href="http://murtra.net/">Almudena Garcia</a> on these design
changes and I whole-heartedly recommend her if you have some front-end (HTML &amp;
CSS) tasks to get done.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There are a couple of other, smaller changes and you can see the whole list in
<a href="https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.13.7+is%3Aclosed">the issues repo</a>. Or you can buy the book <a href="http://rockandrollwithemberjs.com">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s Friday and if it&#8217;s (every 2nd-6th) Friday, it&#8217;s Rock and Roll release day!</p>

<p>Book version 1.13.3 is rolling out as we speak (ok, we don&#8217;t speak and you
probably read this later, but you get the point) which contains the following
changes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Upgrade to Ember version 1.13.3 (the book is in lockstep, too!)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Update to Ember CLI 1.13.1</strong></li>
<li><p><strong>Extended the Components chapter with closure actions.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2015/06/12/ember-1-13-0-released.html#toc_closure-actions">Closure actions</a> are an awesome new way to fire/handle actions introduced
in 1.13 and so it has to be in the book!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extended the Testing chapter with component integration tests.</strong></p>

<p>Integration tests make component tests super simple to set up and so much more
descriptive than unit tests. Our beloved star-rating component is now tested
by the shiny new integration tests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get rid of <code>needs</code> in the controller.</strong></p>

<p>There was one instance where I used this to get a nice placeholder text. As a
preparation for Ember 2.0 where <code>needs</code> is going the way of the dodo, I
removed that nasty <code>needs</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Specify the band-songs relationship as sync.</strong></p>

<p>Starting from 2.0, Ember Data relationships are assumed to be asynchronous
unless otherwise specified. In the Rock &amp; Roll application, we sideload the
songs with the bands, so adding a <code>{ async: false }</code> option to the
relationship was in order.</p></li>
<li><strong>A few CSS fixes, one of them thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/lonekorean">lonekorean</a></strong></li>
</ul>


<p>The whole change list is observable <a href="https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-issues/issues?q=milestone%3A1.13.3+is%3Aclosed">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hoist the sails, Ember 2.0 (and with it, Rock and Roll with Ember 2.0) is on the horizon!</p>
