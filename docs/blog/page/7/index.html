  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I completed the last problem on the <a href="http://4clojure.com">4Clojure</a> site. If you
want to learn Clojure, solving these problems is a great way to do it. Several
of its features -that I&#8217;ll highlight below- make it a great learning tool. Other
features probably arise from <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> being a
(pragmatic) functional programming language. Coming from mostly an OO background
these were also new to me and thus deserve their own paragraph.</p>

<p>I hope that after reading through the list you&#8217;ll end up being persuaded of the
merits and want to solve (some of) the problems yourself. If you do, please let
me know how it went and what you learned from it.</p>

<p>If you really get stuck, there is a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/4clojure">Google group dedicated to the 4Clojure
problems</a>. You can also leave a comment here so I can help or go directly to
check <a href="https://gist.github.com/raw/4008944/9c0577566b9a87e8db03332bf71b6d0b1140748e/4clojure.clj">my solutions</a>. Let&#8217;s jump in.</p>

<h2>Why is 4Clojure a great learning tool?</h2>

<h3>Looking at others&#8217; solutions</h3>

<p>After solving a problem, you can check how the users you follow solved it.
That&#8217;s arguably the most important feature when it comes to learning since it
is essentially a code reading exercise when the functionality of the code is
well-known (since it solves the same problem you&#8217;ve solved) and the authors are
probably more proficient.</p>

<p>On several occasions I saw solutions that were both more concise and clearer
than mine (especially when tackling a hard problem). Dealing with the
inferiority complex on the very short term is dwarved by how much wisdom you
gain from these. For what it&#8217;s worth, the users I learned most from are
<a href="http://www.4clojure.com/user/hypirion">hypirion</a>,
<a href="http://www.4clojure.com/user/jafingerhut">jafingerhut</a> and
<a href="http://www.4clojure.com/user/chouser">chouser</a>.</p>

<p>(If you&#8217;d like to follow me, I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/user/balint">balint</a>
there.)</p>

<h3>Executable, well thought-out test cases</h3>

<p>To submit your solution, you paste your code into a textbox and click a button.
The test cases, which are visible, are then checked one by one. If all the
lamps become green, your solution is accepted. If not, you get an error
message and have to try again.</p>

<p>This method has several advantages. First of all, it eliminates the imprecisions
you might have had after reading the description of the problem. Second, it
gives you a set of examples to work against. Third, they force you to think
deeper about the problem since they are constructed to reject a partial
solution.</p>

<h3>Timeouts</h3>

<p>Your solution can be functional and pass all the test cases but if it does not
finish in a certain time, it will get rejected. I bumped into this on several
occasions. Most of the time it was because I came up with the brute force
solution to a hard problem and hoped I&#8217;d get away with it. In other cases it was
because of a technical issue, like allocating too much memory.</p>

<p>In the first case, it made me think again about the problem (see Hammock-Driven
Development) and come up with a more ingenious solution. In the second case, I
learned something about a technical aspect of the language. In both cases, I
grew a bit wiser about optimization -which is a &#8220;real-world&#8221; coding skill- so
I&#8217;m happy the authors of 4clojure chose to implement this constraint.</p>

<h2>What does one learn about (functional) programming?</h2>

<h3>Hammock-Driven Development</h3>

<p>Also known as “step-away from the computer to solve hard problems”, Hammock-Driven
Development is a term coined by Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure, in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">keynote
speech</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently ridiculing Test Driven Development (TDD), HDD holds that the most
important activity to solve a hard problem is to think deeply about it without
any distractions. Most of the time sitting in front of the computer is a
distraction in itself since it begs to be typed on and prevents actual deep thinking
to happen.</p>

<p>This one is really hard to get used to because whenever we write code we feel like
we&#8217;re getting closer to a solution. Thinking, on the other hand, does not
provide any tangible output.</p>

<p>However, HDD has rung ever more true with me as I progressed. When tackling hard
problems, I tended to think about them for some time and then started to type in
actual code. The problem was, when I felt that the solution became convoluted I
did not go back to the proverbial hammock but carried on with the implementation.
Most of the time it either turned out to be a dead-end or a solution I&#8217;d much
better hide.</p>

<p>Even more importantly, a cleaner solution is one that is easier for
others to understand. Since code is mainly for others to read and occasionally
for computers to execute, more thinking up-front results in less time spent
developing and maintaining the code down the line.</p>

<h3>The REPL is a powerful developer tool</h3>

<p>The power of the REPL is one those realizations most of us coming from OO will
come to. Since FP languages have <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey">very little state</a> and side-effects and
thus a lot of idempotency, trying things at the REPL is taken to the next
level. You launch a REPL once and then copy-paste the building blocks of your
solution between your editor and the REPL (and there are <a href="https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime">better</a>
<a href="https://github.com/kingtim/nrepl.el">solutions</a> then copy-pasting).</p>

<h3>Use higher level functions</h3>

<p>FP languages strive to have a small set of data structures and a high number of
functions that operate on them. Clojure is no exception. Though it&#8217;s not hard to
assemble the higher-level function you need yourself, in the majority of cases,
it&#8217;s just extra work: it&#8217;s probably already defined in the core.</p>

<p>This is something that I learned by reading others&#8217; solutions and learning
about awesome functions (<a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/frequencies">frequencies</a>, <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/merge-with">merge-with</a>, <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/condp">condp</a> come to mind).
After a while I looked up the high-level function myself from <a href="http://clojure.org/cheatsheet">the
cheatsheet</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Switching between applications is more of a mental context switch than just switching between the panes in the same window. Or at least that&#8217;s what I told myself when I decided I switch from using macvim to the simple command line version. It also brings me pretty close to using tmux which I would primarily use to send commands between panes. Most of the posts about using tmux only briefly touch on switching to command line vim so I thought I&#8217;d fill in the gap somewhat.</p>

<p>I use iTerm2 on a MacBook Pro and run 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard), although I think it should run
fine under Lion, too.</p>

<p>First, you&#8217;ll have to install a fairly recent vim. Homebrew has a policy of not having packages which the operating system already provides, but fortunately there is a <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes">homebrew-dupes</a> repository that has vim:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ brew install --HEAD https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/master/vim.rb</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will configure, make and install vim.</p>

<p>Next, I looked for a theme that looks good on both a light and a dark background and has iTerm support (a colorscheme for the terminal emulator). I&#8217;ve found <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Ethan Schoonover&#8217;s solarized theme</a> really cool. Just follow the steps in the <a href="https://github.com/altercation/ethanschoonover.com/tree/master/projects/solarized">README of the repository</a> to download both the vim and the iTerm colorscheme.</p>

<p>To install the iTerm colorscheme, go to Preferences -> Profiles to select your
profile and then click the Colors tab. There is a &#8220;Load Presets&#8221; dropdown from
which you have to choose Import and find the solarized itermcolors file.</p>

<p>To use the vim colorscheme you have to add the colors file to somewhere where
vim finds it. There are many ways to do this, so check out the <a href="https://github.com/altercation/ethanschoonover.com/tree/master/projects/solarized">README</a> to
find the method that suits you.</p>

<p>Once, done you have to set the colorscheme in your vimrc:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>colorscheme solarized</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>(vim finds out the appropriate background automatically, so you don&#8217;t have to
explicitly set the background)</p>

<p>I was all set up and most things worked just like in the GUI version. One thing that bugged me was that my cursor keys stopped working. I don&#8217;t use them for moving and text input but I do for cycling in the command history or flipping between file matches for Command-T. It took me a while to find out that iTerm sends a wrong escape sequence for the arrow keys. I could fix that by selecting another set of key presets for the terminal&#8217;s profile. In iTerm, go to Preferences -> Profiles and select your profile. Select Keys, then Load Preset and select xTerm with Numeric Keypad.</p>

<p>There is one more trick I find handy. If you set</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>set clipboard=unnamed</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>in your config, then anything you copy from vim by the usual vim commands (y, d, x, etc.) will be available on your system clipboard and thus pastable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of us read blog posts every day. We read them, take an idea out of
them and then, most of the time, forget about them. Some of them are stashed
away in the back of our minds, ready to jump out if we face a related
problem.</p>

<p>A precious few of them, however, we keep thinking back to without a specific
reason.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve bitten by the &#8220;mockist&#8221; testing bug when I read <a href="http://jamesgolick.com/2010/3/14/crazy-heretical-and-awesome-the-way-i-write-rails-apps.html">this one</a> a while ago. It expresses a contrarian opinion
about how to test Rails applications which struck me as odd at the time.
That&#8217;s probably the reason I read it several times.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I watched Gregory Moeck&#8217;s <a href="http://confreaks.net/videos/659-rubyconf2011-why-you-don-t-get-mock-objects">Why You Don&#8217;t Get Mock Objects</a> and I was stung by the same bug only more deeply,
this time.</p>

<p>Using that video as a starting point I then roamed Gregory&#8217;s blog for
more and felt like I was beginning to grasp it. Now, obviously, I&#8217;m at the
beginning of this journey and still have a lot of teeth-cutting to do.
Nevertheless, I want to share with you the gems I&#8217;ve found so far.</p>

<p>Gregory&#8217;s blog has a very good primer on the difference between stubs
and mocks: <a href="http://gmoeck.github.com/2011/10/26/stubbing-is-not-enough">&#8220;Stubbing is Not Enough&#8221;</a>. I&#8217;d even go
as far as to claim that it explains its subject better than Martin
Fowler&#8217;s classic <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">&#8220;Stubs Are Not Mocks&#8221;</a>, although that
latter goes into more detail and is a definite must-read, too.</p>

<p>James Golick has another great piece that drives home the point better
than his first post I mentioned: <a href="http://jamesgolick.com/2010/3/10/on-mocks-and-mockist-testing.html">&#8220;On Mocks and Mockist Testing&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>Along comes Avdi Grimm with his strict sounding <a href="http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/07/05/demeter-its-not-just-a-good-idea-its-the-law/">&#8220;Demeter: It’s not just a good idea. It’s the law.&#8221;</a>
, with a very interesting discussion in the comments. The same gentleman
wrote <a href="http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/09/06/making-a-mockery-of-tdd/">&#8220;Making a Mockery of TDD&#8221;</a> in which he
touches on the concept of using mocks as a design tool.</p>

<p>Nick Kallen&#8217;s <a href="http://magicscalingsprinkles.wordpress.com/2010/02/08/why-i-love-everything-you-hate-about-java/">&#8220;Why I love everything you hate about Java&#8221;</a> is clearly provocative
and definitely worth to contemplate on. It is also the only one of the bunch that
does not use Ruby (but Scala) for the code examples.</p>

<p>Finally it seems like the fountainhead in the matter is the <a href="growing">&#8220;Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests&#8221;</a>
book by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce. I&#8217;ve only gotten until putting it
on my reading list so please chime in if you did read it.</p>

<p>Please, also pipe in if there are any materials in the subject you&#8217;d
recommend. It would also be cool to see open source projects that extensively use mocks for testing, the only
one I found so far is <a href="https://github.com/jamesgolick/friendly">friendly</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently got into developing a web application with node.js (aka <a href="http://teddziuba.com/2011/10/node-js-is-cancer.html">cancer</a>).
Coming from a synchronous world, it took (and to be honest, still takes)
quite a while to grok how writing asynchronous code differs from my
previous experiences (AJAX calls with jQuery only go that far).</p>

<p>As with many fine technologies or methods (TDD, NoSQL, functional
programming come to mind) it&#8217;s your whole
thinking that has to change. In this post I want to share an example
from <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/tbcoffee/coffeescript">Trevor Burnham&#8217;s excellent Coffeescript book</a> that gave me one
of those aha moments.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1297011.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;You are being &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gist/1297011&quot;&gt;redirected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>(If you don&#8217;t read Coffeescript code, you can go to the <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">Coffeescript web site</a>
and paste the above example in to get compiled Javascript)</p>

<p>The example above is broken. It gets stuck at the <code>until countdown is 0</code>
row. In an event loop system events (callbacks) only get run after the &#8220;main line&#8221;
of execution (or, in other words, all other code) has completed.
So the until loop blocks out the callback of the setInterval,
countdown never gets decremented and thus an endless loop ensues.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure that there are many ways to fix this, I came up with the
following (and wonder if there is one closer to the original):</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1297018.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;You are being &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gist/1297018&quot;&gt;redirected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>And that&#8217;s it. I hope this simple example pushes you up on that pesky learning curve.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I graduated from the Technical University of Budapest to earn a M.Sc. in
Software Engineering. Albeit it is supposed to be an asset on my CV I&#8217;ll
argue below that the long years of university education was just not worth it.</p>

<p>When trying to summarize what advantage university education
brought me there is precious little I can think of. Five years is a lot of
time to spend without actually getting something out of it for one&#8217;s
professional career.</p>

<p>Obviously I&#8217;ve formed my opinion based on my university experience which
might not (and probably <em>is</em> not) be applicable to all higher education.
Philosophy, economics and law all require different formation
and practice might be harder (or outright dangerous) to attain in some
areas (think medicine).</p>

<p>Also, there is a great variance between countries although even the famously high-standard
US education system seems to yield not actual but rather
looks-good-on-my-CV benefits, say some <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/10/peter-thiel-were-in-a-bubble-and-its-not-the-internet-its-higher-education/" title="Peter Thiel: Education Bubble">smart</a> <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18750658" title="Stephen Wolfram">guys</a>.</p>

<h2>Learn to learn?</h2>

<p>Tech is changing extremely rapidly. Today&#8217;s hotness could be a thing of
the past in a few years. Consequently universities should not try to keep up with the
pace and teach students state-of-the-art stuff. Higher education needs to transcend
short-term utility and provide a base one can build on for the rest of
his career. So we were told or made to believe.</p>

<p>What is probably considered the essence of higher education is &#8220;learn to
learn&#8221;. It is the idea that universities need to teach future-engineers
how to quickly adapt to new fields and techniques (programming
languages, databases, architectures, etc.).</p>

<p>This is appealing but universities don&#8217;t do that. I had to sit through
long hours of material not even vaguely related to software engineering.
The practical stuff (e.g programming languages) was taught with stone age style methods
(programming on paper).  The other subjects, those that were supposed to provide us the broad
vision, I suppose, were way too much in volume and failed to achieve that goal.</p>

<h2>Make to learn</h2>

<p>In my current job I&#8217;m lucky to work with some guys who dropped out of
college and started to work. They might not
know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim's_algorithm" title="Prim's algorithm">Prim&#8217;s algorithm</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem" title="Intermediate value theorem">intermediate value theorem</a>,
but I think the result of the time they spent making things greatly surpass the time I
spent learning the above.</p>

<p>Programming (or, in its more CV-friendly, hire-me name: software
engineering) is a task that could be the modern equivalent of wood carving.
You can learn all that you want about the craft, the only thing that
really matters is doing it, a lot. Only, programming is way better.
There is virtually no waste (unless you publish what you make :) ) and
the tools are more accessible and cheaper.</p>

<p>Take it from someone who, unlike most kiddos at the university, started
programming late: it feels awkward and weird at first. And then the
second and third time, too. Slowly, though, you start to feel like it&#8217;s actually
fun and sometimes more than that. You&#8217;re building something which you&#8217;ll
look at ashamedly a few months later but at least your program does something extraordinary,
like sorting a list of numbers. That&#8217;s science!</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree" title="B-tree">Math data constructs</a>, probability theory and cryptography notwithstanding,
have you got this feeling of coolness (dare I say, awe) out of university lectures?</p>

<h2>Total waste, really?</h2>

<p>In fairness, and as a measure to counter my arrogance, I had to consider arguments
on the pro-education side, too. Here is what I came up with:</p>

<h3>Math</h3>

<p>When faced with a programming challenge I
can recall on some occasions an algorithm used to resolve a similar problem.
That&#8217;s not to say you can&#8217;t google up a solution if you have a vague
idea what to look for. Nevertheless if you can mentally page through the solutions
for a given problem from your university classes, their time and space
needs and their constraints then you surely save a lot of time.
I forgot all the relevant facts about any algorithm and have to look it
up every single time, but it could be me.</p>

<h3>Deciding on one&#8217;s vocation</h3>

<p>Most kids don&#8217;t know what to do with their life when they are 18. Real
life still seems distant and most want a few more years of canteen,
beers and idling. Whether it is beneficial for them or society
(taxpayers) as a whole to be allowed to do that is another matter.
Nevertheless, I&#8217;m convinced that a high number of students can have a
clearer picture about whether they want to do &#8220;computer science&#8221; for the
rest of their lives after a couple of years.</p>

<h3>Outstanding teachers</h3>

<p>Even though I reckon you can learn everything you need to know on your
own (from the Internet), having a good teacher can squeeze your
learning curve. Although I believe this is more attainable with a small
group (and even more in a one-to-one, mentoring relationship) it&#8217;s
definitely possible for an outstanding teacher to speed up absorbing
knowledge with a bigger group, too. Unfortunately, with one notable
exception, my teachers were not of this type, but
that&#8217;s a weak argument against college education in general.</p>

<p>Even if all these pro-education arguments are valid, however, a couple
of years is surely enough to derive all the advantages they bring.
Then, you still have 3 years to go and carve wood.</p>

<h2>On navigation</h2>

<p>Let me finally share a quote I&#8217;ve just found in Walden by H.D. Thoreau and that
summarizes my intent with this post in one swell sentence:</p>

<blockquote><p>To my astonishment I was informed on leaving college that I had studied<br/>navigation! &#8211; why, if I had taken one turn down the harbor I should<br/>have known more about it.</p><footer><strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong> <cite>Walden</cite></footer></blockquote>


<h2>Please defend the status quo (or indulge in bashing it)</h2>

<p>As I stated in the introduction, my opinion is just a drop in the ocean,
a tiny slice in a big cake, a lone voice in the NY Stock Exchange (you
get my point).</p>

<p>If you <a href="http://www.codigoergosum.com/2011/09/28/five-wasted-years-futility-of-university-education.html" title="Comments">share your opinion</a>, there will be two voices already and we&#8217;ll
have more information to decide about whether we should advise our children to go
to college, for example. Then three. We may even reach four voices.</p>

<p>Joking aside, if you went to college to learn computer science in Hungary
or in another country, I&#8217;m interested to <a href="http://www.codigoergosum.com/2011/09/28/five-wasted-years-futility-of-university-education.html" title="Comments">hear your opinion</a>. If you
studied something else, don&#8217;t be discouraged, please <a href="http://www.codigoergosum.com/2011/09/28/five-wasted-years-futility-of-university-education.html" title="Comments">share also</a>. My
points are mostly valid for computer science but I&#8217;m curious to hear
which other fields they hold true in (or in which fields they don&#8217;t).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> is a blogging engine on top of Jekyll. It got my attention
since it provides themes and a layout that looks great on mobile
devices, too.</p>

<p>I had been playing with the idea to do my own simplistic theming long enough
to realize that I would never do it. The other feature I like is its plugin system:
some I&#8217;ll use right away (e.g Github style codeblock) but I also like
the idea that I can write a plugin for any specific need that might
arise later.</p>

<p>I had had my blog on Jekyll so migration was not really hard. I hit a
few minor roadblocks on the way but <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">documentation</a> is great and the author,
Brandon Mathis was really helpful on the <a href="https://convore.com/octopress/">support forum</a> so
I could eventually sort them out.</p>

<time datetime="2011-07-19T00:00:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 19<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&#8217;s say you have the following three commits in your local repository:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>% git log -3 --oneline
</span><span class='line'>b648f1a Fix propagating errors in findOrInitialize. (28 seconds ago)
</span><span class='line'>8789cd1 Non-destructive filtering for bumblebees. (12 hours ago)
</span><span class='line'>1a35285 Propagate errors the node.js way. (14 hours ago)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The last commit, b648f1a conceptually belongs to the first one, 1a35285.
It only came later because say you haven&#8217;t run the tests before
committing it and only realized later you introduced a bug. Or some
other misdemeanor. Whatever the background is, it would be great if
there was a way to squash the two related commits together. Turns out
there is: interactive rebase.</p>

<p>The syntax of the git-rebase is the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git rebase [-i | --interactive] [options] [--onto &lt;newbase>]
</span><span class='line'>             &lt;upstream> [&lt;branch>]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What happens when you do git rebase is that the commits that are on the current
branch but are not in upstream are saved. The current branch is reset to
upstream and then the saved commits are replayed on top of this.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth to mention that you should only do this if you have not
pushed out these changesets to a remote where others might have pulled
from it. Rebase creates new commits and if your collaborators pull the
new commits, chaos can ensue. (See &#8220;Perils of Rebase&#8221; in the <a href="http://progit.org/book/ch3-6.html">ProGit
book</a>)</p>

<p>This can be used to achieve what we want:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>% git rebase -i HEAD~3</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Since the commits that are on the current branch but not on the commit
three commits from here are the last three commits, here is what we get:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pick 1a35285 Propagate errors the node.js way.
</span><span class='line'>pick 8789cd1 Non-destructive filtering for bumblebees.
</span><span class='line'>pick b648f1a Fix propagating errors in findOrInitialize.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We want to meld the &#8220;fix&#8221; commit into the &#8220;propagate&#8221; commit since
that&#8217;s how it should have been in the first place. So we move b648f1a up and
squash it into the previous commit:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pick 1a35285 Propagate errors the node.js way.
</span><span class='line'>squash b648f1a Fix propagating errors in findOrInitialize.
</span><span class='line'>pick 8789cd1 Non-destructive filtering for scales.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After a successful rebase this is how the new log looks like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>% git log -3 --oneline
</span><span class='line'>73eed18 Non-destructive filtering for bumblebees. (9 seconds ago)
</span><span class='line'>1e63d17 Propagate errors the node.js way. (39 seconds ago)
</span><span class='line'>1b24891 Minor fixes in Bumblebee buzzing. (16 hours ago)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that the three commits we had before have now been nicely compacted
into two, and the propagation commit is now consistent and fixed. It can
now be pushed.</p>

<p>ps. You might wonder what we use bumblebees for in our project. Actually
they are faux. They serve to obfuscate real names in propietary code.
I hope I can one day write code where bumblebees will be first-class
citizens, though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a quiet four months over here. My excuse is that I&#8217;ve been working. I joined a startup, <a href="http://secretsaucepartners.com">Secret Sauce Partners</a> in June and we have started to build our first product a couple of weeks later. Now I am proud (actually, quite proud) to announce that we have released a first version last week.</p>

<h2>The problem we are solving</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you have a Facebook account. You probably have around <a href="http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics">130 &#8220;friends&#8221;</a>. Chances are you want to share lots of things but on several occasions you don&#8217;t want to tell everybody. Sure, you can create friend lists and post to them based on what you want to say. Or, you can pick individual friends for your message (good luck with that if you would like to speak to more than 3 friends). It would definitely make sense (and would hugely improve the state of the world!) if you only showed your Farmville achievements to your friends who play Farmville and nobody else. Especially not your colleagues during work hours.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if you did not have to fiddle with setting the proper audience of your posts every single time you share something? If the people whom you post to would be determined from the content and the context of your message? Better still, if friends that join later could not see your posts prior to that?</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s go back to Farmville-land (I know, I know, but bear with me for a few more minutes). If you only want to show your Farmville posts to selected people the only way to achieve it is to set your default privacy to that list of selected friends prior to diving in to FarmVille. Then you set it back to your default posting setting. Not quite comfortable.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s where our application comes into the picture. To solve the above problem, you set up a rule that says:
&#8220;Hide posts from Farmville posted during Work Hours from my Co-Workers&#8221;. You lay back, go feed your piggies, and water your sunflowers safe in the knowledge that your colleagues will not know about it. Suppose you don&#8217;t want your mom to know where you spend your weekends. Here is your rule: &#8220;Hide All posts from Foursquare from Family&#8221;. Feeling the urge to swear like a sailor some times and don&#8217;t want your little cousins or nieces to know about it? &#8220;Always hide posts with Swear Words from Kids&#8221;. Don&#8217;t want to spam your Twitter followers on Facebook? &#8220;Always hide posts from Twitter from Twitter followers&#8221;. Then, there are the &#8220;Show&#8221; rules*. For example, an even more sensible rule for Farmville posts could be: &#8220;Always show posts from Farmville to Players&#8221;.
(* &#8220;Show rules&#8221; are the next feature we are going to work on.)</p>

<p>You see, the possibilities are endless, so why don&#8217;t you <a href="http://donttellmichelle.com/">set up your own rules and give it a try</a>? I bet you will never want to go back to (broken) standard Facebook privacy setting.</p>

<p>Ah, and if you don&#8217;t want your wife to know how much high-cholesterol food you eat, then <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2010/03/dont_tell_michelle_obama_says.html">&#8220;Don&#8217;t Tell Michelle&#8221;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You must have heard the question several times on the Rails mailing list and different IRC channels: &#8220;Should I test validates_uniqueness_of&#8221;? The standard answer to that one is &#8220;No, you definitely should not. It&#8217;s Rails framework code, and it&#8217;s already thoroughly tested. If you followed this path, you should also test whether objects are properly persisted in the database.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think, however, that the question is wrong and thus you can not give a correct answer. It is wrong because validates_uniqueness_of is the implementation, not the requirement. If you approach it from this angle, the question turns into whether you should test the specific implementation or whether you should verify that (business) requirements are met.</p>

<p>That, in turn, comes down to tests vs. specs (short for specifications) and this is again an opportunity for specs to shine. If you write specs instead of tests (or, to put it in a more mind-warping way: if your tests are actually specs), then the above question is a no-brainer: it&#8217;s part of the specification that no two users can have the same email address, so you must have a spec for it:</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>On the other hand, if you stick with calling your tests tests (how orthodox! ;) ) then not only you have to think (which consumes a lot of resources), but you can also come to the wrong conclusion and emit a strong business requirement from your test suite. And then you might not remember to have the implementation for it after modifying the code for whatever reason. And then bad things might happen.</p>

<p>(This thought came to me when coming to work in the subway this morning. I was never quite comfortable with the name &#8220;specs&#8221; but now it&#8217;s starting to make a lot of sense to me. You are encouraged to disagree. Dissent is what makes the world progress.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you reading this probably use TextMate. It is an excellent editor with two caveats. The first is that you can only see one file in the editing window (no screen split), the other is that there is no save hook. This latter gave me headaches since I can&#8217;t stand any trailing whitespace in source code and the easiest solution would have been to run a script to remove those when the file is saved.</p>

<p>Without further ado I&#8217;ll paste my solution below. Obviously this is not a difficult task to accomplish so the goal is to share not to show off. I use Git for SCM and the following solution parses out the files that have been modified and runs the whitespace eraser script for those.

<p>And then you run it by typing:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>rtwsp.sh </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>git status | parse_modified_files_from_git_status.rb | rm_trailing_whitespace.rb
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you decide to use this, it is more convenient to <a href="http://gist.github.com/raw/305654/568290aa63ee3b0b3748b5041654f94ce45f4e5b/erase_trailing_whitespace.rb">download the raw source</a></p>

<p>Hopefully I did my tiny bit to have less trailing whitespace in OS code.</p>
